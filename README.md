# Udacity ES6 Javascript Improved Notes


## Notes:
- **Destructuring** - Borrows inspiration from languages like Perl and Python by allowing you to specify the elements you want to extract from an array or object on the left side of an assignment. 
- **Variadic functions** - Functions that take an indefinite number of arguments.
- **Concise Body Syntax** - The format of the function body. The concise syntax:
  * has no curly braces surrounding the function body
  * and automatically returns the expression.
- **Block Body Syntax** - The block statement is often called compound statement in other languages. It allows you to use multiple statements where JavaScript expects only one statement.
